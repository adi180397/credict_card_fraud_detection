# credict_card_fraud_detection
credit card fraud detection -a ml project build and tested on different algorithm, and able to achieve accuracy, precision and f1_score equal to 100%.
# Project Overview 
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for credit card fraud detection. The model utilizes historical credit card transaction data to identify fraudulent activities and classify them accurately. By leveraging the power of machine learning algorithms, the project aims to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of fraud detection, thereby minimizing financial losses for both credit card companies and cardholders.

# Project Features
Data Preprocessing: The project includes a comprehensive data preprocessing phase where the raw credit card transaction data is cleaned, transformed, and prepared for training the machine learning model. This phase involves handling missing values, removing outliers, and performing feature engineering to enhance the predictive power of the model.

Feature Selection: To optimize the performance of the model and reduce computational overhead, the project incorporates feature selection techniques to identify the most relevant features from the dataset. This process helps to eliminate redundant or irrelevant variables, focusing on the most informative attributes for fraud detection.

Model Training and Evaluation: The project employs various machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, random forests, or gradient boosting, to build and train the fraud detection model. The model is evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Multiple models are tested and compared to select the one with the best performance.

Cross-Validation and Hyperparameter Tuning: To ensure the reliability and generalizability of the model, the project employs cross-validation techniques during the training process. Additionally, hyperparameter tuning is performed to fine-tune the model's parameters, optimizing its performance and preventing overfitting.

Real-time Fraud Detection: Once the model is trained and validated, it can be deployed for real-time credit card fraud detection. New transactions can be inputted into the model, which will provide predictions indicating whether the transaction is fraudulent or legitimate.

Project Structure
